## Project Description

**Vision-Code** is an AI-powered adaptive e-learning platform designed to personalize learning experiences using **Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and **data-driven analytics**. The platform supports role-based access for students, instructors, and administrators, enabling secure authentication, structured course delivery, intelligent content recommendations, and automated proctoring during assessments.

The system is developed following **Agile Scrum methodology**, with incremental delivery across sprints.

---

## Features Implemented (Sprint 1)

### Core System

* Secure user registration and login (Student / Instructor / Admin)
* Role-based authentication and authorization
* Session and token management
* Responsive landing and dashboard interfaces

### Learning Management

* Student panel with:

  * Article-based learning system
  * Courses, modules, and structured content
  * Quiz panel with automated evaluation
* Instructor panel with:

  * Course creation and publishing
  * Module and content management

### AI & Computer Vision (Prototype)

* Attention and proctoring module:

  * Eye gaze attention tracking
  * Face recognition
  * Multiple face detection
  * Sound detection during assessments
* Machine Learning–based content recommendation system *(training & testing phase)*
* Adaptive learning roadmap recommendation system *(training & testing phase)*

---

## System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture Overview

The platform follows a **modular client–server architecture** with integrated AI services:

1. **Frontend Layer**

   * Web-based user interfaces for Students, Instructors, and Admins
   * Communicates with backend services via REST APIs

2. **Backend Layer**

   * Django + Django REST Framework
   * Handles authentication, business logic, course management, and APIs

3. **Database Layer**

   * Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL (Supabase)
   * Stores user data, course content, quiz results, and logs

4. **AI & ML Layer**

   * Recommendation engines for content and learning paths
   * Computer Vision services for attention tracking and proctoring

5. **External Services**

   * Supabase for managed PostgreSQL and scalability
